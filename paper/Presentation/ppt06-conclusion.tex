  \subsection{Limitation}
  \begin{block}{Limitation}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Small dataset : overfitted\\
        $\rightarrow$ need to be verified with bigger and various dataset.
        \item Heuristic approach
    \end{itemize}

  \subsection{Future work}
  \begin{block}{Future Work}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Theoretical foundation that explains why it works.\\
        (if possible..)
        \item Ablation study with various sampling rate
    \end{itemize}

\subsection{summary}
\begin{frame}{Summary}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item We propose a novel, yet simple, training scheme of stereo audio generative model
        \item Namely, be reparameterize L-R channel into M-S channel
        \item We introduce a new dataset composed of two channel stereo audios with rich stereo images
        \item Both quantitative and qualitative results show that our method is superior to the conventional method in generating stereo audio samples.
    \end{itemize}
