\begin{abstract}
Automating audio generation and synthesis is a key building block of advanced computer listening applications such as auto composition. Whilst various audio generative neural networks exist that target producing audio with both high-fidelity and global structure, far less attention has been paid to generate stereo audio, which is essential to satisfy the listeners. In this paper, we propose a simple but effective training scheme for stereo audio generation task by reparameterizing left-right channels to Mid-Side channels. To address this problem, we first introduce a novel public dataset\footnote{Dataset and code are available on \url{https://github.com/changwoonchoi/ml2020}} which features 960 short high-fidelity stereo audios. We also propose new representations, namely \textit{`Side Distance'} and \textit{`Short-time Side Distance'} that effectively capture the stereo image of stereo audio. Our results clearly show that proposed method is superior to the conventional method in generating stereo audio samples on both quantitative and qualitative evaluations.
