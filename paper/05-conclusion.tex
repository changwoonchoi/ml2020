\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
In this paper, we propose a novel, yet simple, training scheme for a stereo audio generative model. Also, we introduce a new dataset composed of two-channel stereo audios with rich stereo images. By reparameterizing the L-R channel into the M-S channel, the experiments on the proposed dataset demonstrate that our proposed training scheme gives promising results on every evaluation metrics (MMD, COV, 1-NNA). Furthermore, the study on human evaluations shows that our method is superior to the conventional method in terms of audio quality.
